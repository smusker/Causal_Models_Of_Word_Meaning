        prompt+="""In this study we are studying knowledge of daily life activities. On the next pages you will find several short stories or scenarios, describing events in the daily lives of two characters. Each scenario is different from the others.
Read each one carefully. As you read them, imagine to yourself what is happening. In each scenario, there are two characters. The names of the two characters in all the scenarios are Jane and John. Jane has a young child, called John, who is constantly running around the house and trying new things.
Please use a 7 point rating scale in order to answer the first question that follows a scenario. A 1 always means “not at all”, a 4 means “somewhat”, and a 7 means “very well.”
Here are three examples that will help you to get used to this procedure.
First example:
Jane was reading a book that she was very interested in, and remembered she had to make a phone call. While she made the phone call, she left her book on the table. While Jane was on the phone, John looked for something to do. He saw the book that Jane was reading, picked it up, and browsed through it.
Question:
Does this scenario illustrate a situation where Jane is going to be mad at John?
Answer (respond with only a number between 1 and 7 inclusive, with 1 being "not at all" and 7 being "very well"): 1
Here is a second scenario:
On a certain occasion Jane was feeling stressed, extremely tired, and grouchy. To get her mind off her worries, she decided to watch some TV. While Jane was watching TV, John started to complain that he was hungry. Reluctantly, Jane had to get up and fix him something to eat.
Question:
Does this scenario illustrate a situation where Jane is going to be mad at John?
Answer (respond with only a number between 1 and 7 inclusive, with 1 being "not at all" and 7 being "very well"): 2
Here is a third scenario:
One day, Jane was getting ready to go out. She had decided to wear a nice outfit that she had recently bought. She left the outfit over her bed, and took a shower. While Jane was taking a shower, John came into the room carrying a permanent marker he found elsewhere. He decided to climb onto the bed, and in doing so he stained Jane’s outfit.
Question:
Does this scenario illustrate a situation where Jane is going to be mad at John?
Answer (respond with only a number between 1 and 7 inclusive, with 1 being "not at all" and 7 being "very well"): 7
The three examples you just read are about emotions. In contrast, the scenarios that you will read and rate next are not about emotions. However, they have the same structure."""

One day Jane wanted to loosen the soil in her garden pots, but she didn’t have anything to do it with. So she decided to make something. She gathered all the materials and made it. When she finished, she left it in the garden so she could use it later. The object had three prongs and a handle. Later that day, John was looking for something to loosen the soil in the garden. He saw the object that Jane had made and thought that it would be good for loosening the soil in the garden. He grabbed the object by the handle and repeatedly pushed the prongs into the garden soil.

One day Jane was working in her metal shop, and she decided to make something. She gathered all the materials and started to work. As she worked, metal scraps were left to the side of her table. One of the scrap pieces looked like a spherical piece of metal with a handle attached to it. Later that day, John was looking for something play with. He saw the object that Jane had made and thought that it would be good for playing with. He grabbed the object from the spherical part, and repeatedly waved it above his head.

One day Jane was working in her metal shop, and she decided to make something. She gathered all the materials and started to work. As she worked, metal scraps were left to the side of her table. One of the scrap pieces looked like a wire twisted in different ways. Later that day, John was looking for something play with. He saw the object that Jane had made and thought that it would be good for playing with. He grabbed the object from both sides, and repeatedly squeezed it with his hands.

One day Jane wanted to hang her clothes, but she didn’t have anything to do it with. So she decided to make something. She gathered all the materials and made it. When she finished, she left it in her room so she could use it later. The object was a long wire shaped like the outline of a person's shoulders, and with a hook on the top. Later that day, John was looking for something to hang his clothes on. He saw the object that Jane had made and thought that it would be good for hanging his clothes on. He grabbed the object and fit it inside his T shirt so that the hook came out through the neck.
