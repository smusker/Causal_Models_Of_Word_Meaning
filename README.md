# Causal_Models_Of_Word_Meaning

A re-implementation of an experiment testing whether subjects use the Causal Model hypothesized by HIPE theory to represent artifacts (in this case, "mop", "pencil", and "whistle". 

The original experiment is due to Chaigneau, Sloman, and Barsalou and is documented here: https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=fcd3f8d38dd6aad8878059024fb6762da13c133d

The original paper is "Assessing the Causal Structure of Function" (2004). 

We re-implement the experiment on GPT-3 and -4. 

The paper linked above does not include the full scenario texts. To recover the full texts, we make use of Sergio Chaigneau's Emory Ph.D. thesis ("Studies in the conceptual structure of object function", 2002).
